The core XGS routines are defined in xgs.core.tcl. These are not, by 
themselves, enough to run a simulation. Instead the ::xgs namespace must be
"completed" in order to define a specific method with a given parameter space. 
In addition to new NAMD keywords, two main XGS commands are defined, each with
different uses and requirements:

------------------------------
xgsRun requires the following:
------------------------------

::xgs::parameterSetup
  Perform NAMD keyword setup specific to the method.

::xgs::updateState oldIndex newIndex
  Update the state parameters after a MC step. This should accept state 
  indices for the old and new state (these may be the same) and update
  the parameters (e.g. the thermostat temperature) accordingly.

and at least one of:

::xgs::computePairPotential oldIndex newIndex
  Compute the (reduced) pair potential betwee two states. This is only needed
  for neighbor sampling and is used in the Gibbs sampling procedure.

::xgs::computeNormedWeights
  Compute the normalized probability weights of _all_ states. This is only
  needed for independence sampling methods.

------------------------------------
xgsCalibrate requires the following:
------------------------------------

::xgs::setupCalibration
  Allocate a list for storing calibration data.

::xgs::accumulateCalibration energyMeans index
  Accumulate data for the calibration. This should accept the variable returned
  by setupCalibration (e.g. a list or list of lists) and a state index and
  update the elements accordingly (i.e. accumulate an average).

::xgs::computeCalibration energyMeans
  Accept the accumulated data and return an estimate of both the state weights
  and the instantaneous work variance between neighboring states.
